# Sum Consecutive Duplicates

This aim of this project is to:
1. __Solve a kata__
2. __Provide visual feedback__ of the solution algorithm

## Kata

The problem is as follows:

> _"Implement a function `sumConsecutiveDuplicates()` which adds together all the consecutive numbers in an array and pushes them into a new array. For extra credit, write a function `reduceConsecutives()` which recursively uses your `sumConsecutiveDuplicates()` function to reduce the array down until there are no more consecutive duplicate numbers."_

The original kata can be found here:

## Tech Stack

- `javascript` was used for providing a solution to the kata
- `HTML` and vanilla `CSS` were used to provide visual feedback and animations via a web page
- `jest` npm package was used to test the javascript solution function

## Using This Repo

Installation:

1. Fork this github repo
2. Install dependencies by typing `npm install` in terminal

To view the visual representation of the solution algorithm, load `frontend/sumConsecutiveDuplicates.html`.

To view the results of the test suite, use the terminal command `npm test sum`.

The solution itself can be found in `sumConsecutiveDuplicates.js`.
